                    Harrat Uwayrid nature reserve Saudi Arabia's second biosphere reserve, situated in the nation's
                    west, provides sanctuary for species at critical risk globally, including the Arabian leopard and
                    Arabian gazelle, along with native plant species. Around 50,000 inhabitants in the surrounding and
                    transitional zones rely primarily on agricultural and pastoral pursuits for their livelihood, such
                    as raising camels, sheep, and goats.
