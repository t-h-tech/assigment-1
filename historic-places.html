                    Al-Hegra archaeological site in Saudi Arabia is recognized as the kingdom's first UNESCO World
                    Heritage Site.Human life evidence at the site dates back to the first millennium BCE.
                    Al-Hegra is known for over 110 tombs carved by the Nabataeans into the rock formations to bury
                    individuals of high status within the Nabataean civilization. Inscriptions and writings are clearly
                    visible on some of the tombs, narrating details about the historical figures buried there, including
                    healers, distinguished military figures, local leaders, and many others.

                    The Old Town of AlUla, established in the 12th century, served as a crucial stop
                    along ancient caravan routes laden with frankincense and as a key resting station on the pilgrimage
                    route from Damascus to Mecca. Its towering castle, built approximately in the 10th century, stands
                    at 45 meters high, functioning as a watchtower and a fortification for the town's wall, which
                    featured 14 gates. Together, these narratives paint a picture of AlUla's historical significance as
                    a commercial and spiritual hub, steeped in centuries of tradition and heritage.
