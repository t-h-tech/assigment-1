                <h1>Dadanite Kingdom</h1>
                <p>The Dadanite Kingdom is known for its majestic red rocks and the archaeological epicenter of the
                    Dadanite and Lihyanite civilizations. This area, rich in history, continues to reveal secrets of the
                    past and is now being developed for new resorts and educational institutes focusing on
                    archaeological studies.</p>

                <h1>Lihyanite Kingdom</h1>
                <p>The Lihyanite Kingdom, closely associated with the Dadanites, played a significant role in the trade
                    routes across the Arabian Peninsula. The Lihyanites contributed significantly to the cultural and
                    architectural heritage of AlUla, leaving behind inscriptions and monumental tombs.</p>

                <h1>Nabataean Kingdom  </h1>
                <p>The Nabataean Kingdom left a profound impact on AlUla, most famously through Hegra, Saudi Arabia's
                    first UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Nabataeans were known for their hydraulic engineering,
                    agriculture, and trade networks that stretched across the region. Hegra features over 110
                    well-preserved tombs with elaborate facades cut into the sandstone outcrops.</p>
